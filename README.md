The Hangman is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. <br> Players compete against the computer to guess the correct word chosen by the computer.

## How to play
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word. If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the computer types it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, computer adds one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.
