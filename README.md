# The Hangman
The Hangman is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. <br> Players compete against the computer to guess the correct word chosen by the computer. Players can choose from three categories: Flowers, Trees, and Birds. During the game, the computer provides hints if needed. The game ends when the word is guessed or the player runs out of guesses. <br><br> Please see the live version of [Hangman](https://hangman12-8daeb7aeaeed.herokuapp.com/) <br><br>

## How to play
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word. If the player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the computer types it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, computer adds one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.

## Data Model
The data model consists primarily of dictionaries (divisions and hints), lists (guessed_letters, guessed_words), strings (word, word_completion), and integers (tries, max_tries, score, hints_used).<br>
The game state is dynamic and updates based on the player's interactions and guesses.
The functions manage user inputs, update game data, and control game flow.<br>

## Testing
I have tested this project in PEP8 - i can confirm, no issues<br><br>
Entered invalid data, numbers instead of letters, input twice the same letter<br><br>
Tested in my own computers`s terminal and the Code Institute terminal<br><br>

### Bugs
When I was writting the code my stick figure were showing reversed way. I fixed it changing code: return stages[tries] to return stages[max_tries - tries - 1].

### Remaining Bugs
None

### Validator Testing
It had indicated code lines to be long for my hint section. When I changed them my terminal did not allow me to run the code and showed syntax error and I could not run the code.<br><br>

## Deployment
This project was deployed using Code Institute`s mock terminal for Heroku.
<li>Cloned Code Institute`s repository</li>
<li>In Heroku created a new app</li>
<li>Add the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS as per instructions provided</li>
<li>Link Heroku app to GitHub repository and deployed</li>
